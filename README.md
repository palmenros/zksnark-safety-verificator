# Circom Safety Verification

This repository contains a modular algorithm for verifying the safety of Circom circuits written in Rust.

The modular algorithm combines heuristics and algebraic methods based on Gr√∂bner bases in order to efficiently verify
large Circom circuits.

## How to use

In order to verify a component, you need a folder with the following files related to that component, all generated by
the Circom compiler:

- `circuit_constraints.json`: JSON file containing the representation of all R1CS constraints.
- `witness.json`: JSON file containing a valid witness for the circuit.
- `circuit_treeconstraints.json`: JSON file containing the tree module structure of a given Circom circuit.
- `circuit_signals.sym`: File containing the map from signal indices to signal names.

An example folder with all required files is provided in `test/binsubtest4bit`.

Once all required files have been generated, the verifier can be run using

``cargo run -- $folder_path$``
